second_seminar_abstract: "The talk will discuss cooperative control of multi-agents on a sphere and in the Euclidean space. We will first consider the control law design of agents on a sphere, and analyze the stability, scaling, and geometry properties, and discuss future directions. Then, for agents evolving in the Euclidean space, we will consider coupled agents with second-order dynamics. The state of a single agent includes both position and velocity, thus generally, the agents have both velocity coupling and position couplings (VCPC); and if we consider different VCPC, then interesting yet difficult problems arise. We then discuss two aspects of analysis on consensus convergence , and future directions."
